1. Using Terraform
Prerequisites
Install Terraform on your machine.
Ensure you have AWS credentials set up with sufficient permissions to create the required resources.
Steps
Install Terraform
Download and install Terraform from the official site.

Set AWS Credentials
Configure AWS credentials using the CLI or environment variables:

bash
Copy code
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
Initialize Terraform
Run the following command to initialize Terraform:

bash
Copy code
terraform init
Plan the Infrastructure
Preview the changes Terraform will make:

bash
Copy code
terraform plan
Apply the Changes
Deploy the infrastructure:

bash
Copy code
terraform apply
2. Using the CI/CD Pipeline
The CI/CD pipeline is defined in the .gitlab-ci.yml file and automates infrastructure provisioning, application deployment, and failover synchronization.

Pipeline Stages
The pipeline includes the following stages:

init: Initializes Terraform for the primary and failover regions.
plan: Plans the infrastructure for both regions.
apply: Deploys the infrastructure in both regions.
build: Builds the React and Svelte front-end applications.
deploy: Deploys front-end, back-end, and microservices.
failover_sync: Synchronizes data (e.g., S3 buckets, RDS replicas) between primary and failover regions.
rollback: Rolls back changes in case of deployment failures.
Setting Up GitLab CI/CD
Add the following environment variables to your GitLab CI/CD project settings:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_REGION_PRIMARY (e.g., us-east-1)
AWS_REGION_FAILOVER (e.g., us-west-2)
Push changes to the repository to trigger the pipeline:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Trigger pipeline"
git push origin main
